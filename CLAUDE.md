# Solas Rún — Personal Operating System

## Project Overview

Solas Rún is a personal operating system built on Laravel 12, Filament v5, and PostgreSQL 15+. It manages goals, projects, tasks (hierarchical tree), habits, daily plans, journal entries, weekly reviews, meeting notes, calendar events, deferred items, opportunity pipeline, and budgets across 6 life areas.

- **URL**: https://goals26.test (Laravel Herd)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on port 5468, user `postgres`, database `solas_run`
- **Admin Panel**: Filament v5 at `/admin`
- **Testing**: Pest v4 (PHPUnit 12) + Playwright browser testing
- **MCP Servers**: `laravel-boost` (Boost tools) + `solas-run` (34 model read/write access)

## Development Philosophy: Think First, Code Second

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis — ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST

**Search before building.** Before implementing anything:
1. Search the codebase for similar implementations (`Grep`, `Glob`)
2. Check sibling files for existing patterns and conventions
3. Map integration points: models, services, Filament resources, tests
4. Review the relevant service class if one exists

This prevents architectural drift and ensures consistency. New code should look like existing code.

### Phase 2: Plan & Validate

For non-trivial features, use plan mode to:
- Document the approach before writing code
- Identify all files that need changes
- Consider edge cases and error paths
- Get user approval before implementing

### Phase 3: Implement & Verify

- Implement step by step, testing as you go
- Run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` after PHP changes
- Run `npm run build` after frontend changes
- Verify with `./vendor/bin/pest` for the affected area
- Run browser tests with `./vendor/bin/pest tests/Browser/` for UI changes

## Independent Thought — Challenge Assumptions

Going forward, avoid simply agreeing with my points or taking my conclusions at face value. I want a real intellectual challenge, not just affirmation.

- Question my assumptions. What am I treating as true that might be questionable?
- If you see a better approach, say so directly — don't just implement what I ask
- Push back on questionable architectural decisions
- Suggest alternatives when my approach has trade-offs I might not see

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Task Explorer (Hierarchical)
- Tasks form a tree via `parent_id` with materialized `path` for efficient queries
- `is_leaf` flag marks actionable tasks; non-leaf tasks are containers
- `plan` and `context` TEXT fields store AI session memory per task
- `TaskTreeService` handles tree operations (add child, complete leaf, propagate upward)
- Quality gates trigger when all sibling leaves are complete

### Multi-Tenancy
- 26 of 34 models use `HasTenant` trait with `TenantScope` (user_id based)
- MCP server bypasses tenant scopes via `withoutGlobalScopes()` (local-only, no auth)
- 8 models without tenant: User, HabitLog, TimeBlock, AgendaItem, Milestone, GoogleToken, EmailThread

### Database Conventions
- **PostgreSQL**: Use `ilike` for case-insensitive search, `array_position()` instead of MySQL's `FIELD()`
- **Money**: Stored as `decimal(10,2)` — actual dollar amounts, NOT cents
- **Dates**: Use Carbon via `date` or `datetime` casts
- **Enums**: Stored as varchar strings, not PHP BackedEnums
- **JSON arrays**: Use `jsonb` column type (e.g., tags, outcomes_met, checklist)

### Service Layer Pattern
All business logic lives in service classes (`app/Services/`):
- `TaskTreeService` — Tree CRUD, completion propagation, actionable leaves
- `DailyPlanService` — Plan generation, time block scheduling
- `QualityGateService` — Trigger and evaluate quality gates
- `DecompositionInterviewService` — AI-guided task breakdown
- `DeferralService` — Defer tasks, manage revisit cycles
- `OpportunityPipelineService` — Track commercial opportunities
- `MeetingIntelligenceService` — Analyze meeting transcripts
- `HabitStreakService` — Calculate streaks, detect patterns
- `GoalProgressService` — Aggregate progress across tasks/milestones
- `BudgetService` — Track project budgets and burn rates
- `AgendaService` — Meeting agenda generation
- `AiService` — AI interaction orchestration
- `OnboardingService` — User onboarding flow
- `GranolaSyncService` / `GranolaMcpClient` — Meeting transcript sync
- `GoogleCalendarOAuthService` — Google Calendar OAuth 2.0 flow
- `GoogleCalendarSyncService` — Sync events from Google Calendar
- `FreeScoutApiClient` — FreeScout REST API client
- `FreeScoutSyncService` — Email conversation sync (mailboxes, conversations, contacts)
- `EmailIntelligenceService` — AI analysis of email conversations, agent quality scoring

### Filament Resources (23 total)
Every model with a Filament resource follows the same pattern:
- Table with filters, search, and bulk actions
- Create/Edit forms with proper validation
- Relation managers where applicable
- Located in `app/Filament/Resources/`

### Custom Pages
- `Dashboard` — 10 widgets showing daily plan, habits, goals, pipeline
- `TaskExplorer` — Interactive hierarchical task visualization
- `GoogleCalendarSettings` — Google Calendar OAuth and sync configuration
- `FreeScoutSettings` — FreeScout email integration and sync configuration

### MCP Server Architecture
The `solas-run` MCP server (`app/Mcp/`) uses a generic data-driven approach:
- `ModelRegistry` — Central config for all 34 models (filters, searchable fields, dates)
- `ModelResolver` — Query builder + schema introspection
- `InspectModel` tool — Schema for any model (68 tools total: inspect + list per model)
- `ListModels` tool — Query with filters, search, pagination
- `ModelRecord` resource — Fetch single record by URI template
- `UpdateTaskPlan` / `UpdateTaskContext` tools — Write task memory fields

## Task Memory System

Each task has `plan` and `context` TEXT columns for AI session persistence:
- **plan**: Implementation steps, approach, architecture decisions
- **context**: Key files, specifications, requirements, and decisions
- Use MCP tools `update-task-plan` and `update-task-context` to save before ending a session
- Subtasks inherit the parent's project/goal context but have their own plan and context

## Skills Activation (Custom)

In addition to the Boost-provided skills, this project has:

- `laravel-filament-development` — Filament v5 resource patterns, form builders, table builders, widgets, pages, relation managers. Activate when building or modifying Filament resources, forms, tables, widgets, or admin panel pages.
- `phpunit-testing` — Integration-first testing with Pest v4 (on PHPUnit 12), factories, database assertions, and Playwright browser testing. Activate when writing or modifying tests.
- `development-planning` — Structured planning for multi-file features, with task context persistence. Activate when entering plan mode or starting a complex feature.

=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.17
- filament/filament (FILAMENT) - v3
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v3
- laravel/boost (BOOST) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pail (PAIL) - v1
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `tailwindcss-development` — Styles applications using Tailwind CSS v4 utilities. Activates when adding styles, restyling components, working with gradients, spacing, layout, flex, grid, responsive design, dark mode, colors, typography, or borders; or when the user mentions CSS, styling, classes, Tailwind, restyle, hero section, cards, buttons, or any visual/UI changes.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->
```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs for the user.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(S). It is always available through Laravel Herd.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}` to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should cover all happy paths, failure paths, and edge cases.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files; these are core to the application.

## Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

# Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with a Tailwind CSS or styling-related task.

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is used by this application, check how and where to follow existing application conventions.
- Filament is a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Laravel. It allows developers to define user interfaces in PHP using structured configuration objects. It is built on top of Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get information from the official Filament documentation when needed. This is very useful for Artisan command arguments, specific code examples, testing functionality, relationship management, and ensuring you're following idiomatic practices.
- Utilize static `make()` methods for consistent component initialization.

### Artisan

- You must use the Filament specific Artisan commands to create new files or components for Filament. You can find these with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or with `php artisan` and the `--help` option.
- Inspect the required options, always pass `--no-interaction`, and valid arguments for other options when applicable.

### Filament's Core Features

- Actions: Handle doing something within the application, often with a button or link. Actions encapsulate the UI, the interactive modal window, and the logic that should be executed when the modal window is submitted. They can be used anywhere in the UI and are commonly used to perform one-time actions like deleting a record, sending an email, or updating data in the database based on modal form input.
- Forms: Dynamic forms rendered within other features, such as resources, action modals, table filters, and more.
- Infolists: Read-only lists of data.
- Notifications: Flash notifications displayed to users within the application.
- Panels: The top-level container in Filament that can include all other features like pages, resources, forms, tables, notifications, actions, infolists, and widgets.
- Resources: Static classes that are used to build CRUD interfaces for Eloquent models. Typically live in `app/Filament/Resources`.
- Schemas: Represent components that define the structure and behavior of the UI, such as forms, tables, or lists.
- Tables: Interactive tables with filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.
- Widgets: Small component included within dashboards, often used for displaying data in charts, tables, or as a stat.

### Relationships

- Determine if you can use the `relationship()` method on form components when you need `options` for a select, checkbox, repeater, or when building a `Fieldset`:

<code-snippet name="Relationship example for Form Select" lang="php">
Forms\Components\Select::make('user_id')
    ->label('Author')
    ->relationship('author')
    ->required(),
</code-snippet>

## Testing

- It's important to test Filament functionality for user satisfaction.
- Ensure that you are authenticated to access the application within the test.
- Filament uses Livewire, so start assertions with `livewire()` or `Livewire::test()`.

### Example Tests

<code-snippet name="Filament Table Test" lang="php">
    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
        ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1))
        ->searchTable($users->last()->email)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(-1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->take($users->count() - 1));
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Filament Create Resource Test" lang="php">
    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => 'Howdy',
            'email' => 'howdy@example.com',
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertRedirect();

    assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
        'name' => 'Howdy',
        'email' => 'howdy@example.com',
    ]);
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing Multiple Panels (setup())" lang="php">
    use Filament\Facades\Filament;

    Filament::setCurrentPanel('app');
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Calling an Action in a Test" lang="php">
    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])->callAction('send');

    expect($invoice->refresh())->isSent()->toBeTrue();
</code-snippet>

## Version 3 Changes To Focus On

- Resources are located in `app/Filament/Resources/` directory.
- Resource pages (List, Create, Edit) are auto-generated within the resource's directory - e.g., `app/Filament/Resources/PostResource/Pages/`.
- Forms use the `Forms\Components` namespace for form fields.
- Tables use the `Tables\Columns` namespace for table columns.
- A new `Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor` component is available.
- Form and table schemas now use fluent method chaining.
- Added `php artisan filament:optimize` command for production optimization.
- Requires implementing `FilamentUser` contract for production access control.
